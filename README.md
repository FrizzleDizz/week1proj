# week1proj
Splash page completed & updated with comments to organise code

Requirements met:
1: Set up page structure under a .html file
2: Set up page with three primary sections (header, main, footer)
3: Added company name and nav links to header
4: Made use of sections and div's to lay out page content
5: Made use of h1, h2, and an a link
6: Added various background images to each section
7: Made use of absolute positioning to keep the header at the top of the page

What went well:
1: easily implemented, done within time frame
2: no heavy debugging necessary in coding phase
3: when uploading to GitHub from the console I had edited the README file from the browser, and the pull was not committing one way which wouldn't enable me to push the code, this was resolved & I learned through research how to commit both ways.
